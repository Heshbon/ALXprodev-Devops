# ALXprodev-Devops

This repository contains advanced DevOps tasks and projects completed as part of the **ALX ProDev Backend Program**. The focus is on real-world, hands-on automation and scripting, primarily using shell tools and Bash.

Each task is incrementally designed to demonstrate specific shell scripting concepts, which includes: 

- Fetching data from public APIs (PokéAPI).
- Parsing and storing JSON data.
- Implementing retry logic for failed requests.
- Running parallel background processes, etc.

All scripts interact with the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve Pokémon data.
